For years the online version of the book *QCA with R* lived at bookdown.org (`https://bookdown.org/dusadrian/QCAbook/`). Bookdown hosting is being phased out, so I have moved the live version to a new address:

-   <https://dusadrian.github.io/QCAbook/>

The content and look are unchanged: it is still has the same look and feel, just served from GitHub Pages. Please update your bookmarks and links to the new URL. The source remains on GitHub at <https://github.com/dusadrian/QCAbook>, and future updates will be published from there.

If you spot any broken links or layout quirks after the move, let me know so I can fix them quickly.
